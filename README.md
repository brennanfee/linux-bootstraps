# linux-bootstraps

Repository with shell scripts to bootstrap installations of various Linux distributions.

## Overview

These scripts are various ways to automate much of the installation of various Linux distributions.

Most of the shell scripts mimic the "Arch Way" of installing things with both Arch based and Debian based systems supported.  Along with those are pre-seed files for Debian as well as the new method for Ubuntu.  Those installs still rely on the base installer however and generally use the "default" settings for things like disk layout.

The "Arch Way" scripts support far more complex and customized scenarios.  The scripts support full automation by setting some environment variables prior to execution or the scripts can prompt you for the various options along the way.

Note: **THIS PROJECT IS IN HEAVY DEVELOPMENT AND UNSTABLE**
